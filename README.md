# Shape Experiment

The shape experiment is a project designed to collect information about shape recognition.

As more data is collected, code that is used for analysis will be posted here.

Sets of data will also be made public, but if sufficiently large will be hosted elsewhere. 

## Technical

Currently the application runs in HTML5/JavaScript, and is hosted on nginx.

Logs are collected by way of nginx requests.  The requesting URL contains all of the necessary data.

Google Analytics is used to get general site use information.
